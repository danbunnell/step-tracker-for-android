[![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-green.svg)](https://github.com/danbunnell/step-tracker-for-android)[![GitHub Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/danbunnell/step-tracker-for-android.svg)](https://github.com/danbunnell/step-tracker-for-android/issues) 

This is an Android application that uses signal processing to convert accelerometer sensor data into step count.  The application's interface was designed to engage the user by displaying their step count in a way that encourages excercise.

The application also provides a debugging interface that displayed raw and smoothed accelerometer data, the current step count according to the accelerometer processing, and the step count from the device's built-in Step Detector Sensor.

## About

This app was built as part of an assignment for the Ubiquitous Computing course taught by [Jon Froehlich](https://github.com/jonfroehlich) in the Spring 2018  quarter at the University of Washington.  The purpose of the assignment was to learn Android development, consume data from a device's sensors, perform signal processing, and to learn about how effective interface design should incorporate an element of user engagement.
